Miscellaneous HTML+JavaScript tools built mostly with the help of LLMs.

Idea & infrastructure setup stolen from [Simon Willison's tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools), adapted and simplified for my simpler needs.

The [colophon](https://tools.mathspp.com/colophon) lists commit messages and transcripts for every tool.
