# What time is it for me?

This tool helps compare a chosen moment across timezones and share it with others. On load, the visitor's timezone is detected via their IP address and falls back to the browser's reported timezone.

By selecting a date, time, and timezone, you can compare it across different timezones. You can also share a link to a fixed date/time/timezone combo so others can see it in their own timezone.
