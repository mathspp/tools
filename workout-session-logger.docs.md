Log workouts from existing templates served by the Cloudflare Worker. With the API base URL and bearer token saved once in Workout Settings, refresh and choose a template, prefill weights/reps from the latest session, jot progression notes and RIR targets, autosave drafts locally per template, and submit the finished session (with date and overall notes) back to the new /api/templates and /api/sessions endpoints. This replaces the legacy Workout Logger tool that relied on the old API.
