Social Link Preview Inspector audits a URL for metadata that powers link unfurls across major social platforms. Enter a page address and the tool fetches the HTML (with a fallback proxy for CORS-blocked origins), parses the document head, and evaluates SEO best practices alongside Open Graph and Twitter Card tags. It lists each guideline with a pass/fail indicator and renders simulated previews for LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Mastodon, and BlueSky based on the discovered metadata.
