Social Link Preview Inspector audits a URL for metadata that powers link unfurls across major social platforms. Enter a page address and the tool sends the request to a dedicated Cloudflare Worker, which fetches the HTML server-side, extracts the key metadata, and returns a ready-made health report. The frontend renders the worker’s results, listing each guideline with a pass/fail indicator and simulated previews for LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Mastodon, and BlueSky. When served from tools.mathspp.com you can paste site-relative paths and they will be resolved against mathspp.com automatically, making it easy to audit pages from the same domain.
